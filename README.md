# OpenField_Photometry
Analysis of DLC behaviour data and photometry data for open field using MATLAB.

## About the scripts
- **EmptyCage_Deeplabcut_Analysis:** Behavioural analysis of DLC data before and after mice enter rotarod
- **Rotarod_TrimVideos:** Trims rotarod videos to produce 4.5 minute before and after empty cage videos
- **2-3MonthMice_OrderDataForPrism:** Takes ASCII data values and generates a table to copy into Prism
- **newOpenField_Deeplabcut_Analysis:** Behavioural analysis of DLC open field data including quadrant and minute by minute analysis
- **oldOpenField_Deeplabcut_Analysis:** Behavioural analysis of DLC open field data
- **openField_topView_Deeplabcut_Analysis:** Behavioural analysis of DLC open field data of mice with camera above cage
- **GCaMP_SpectralAnalysisWithoutDemodulation:** GCaMP spectral analysis with Fast Fourier Transform of hardware filtered data
- **GCaMP_SpectralAnalysisWithDemodulation:** GCaMP spectral analysis with demodulation of lock-in amplification carrier frequencies
